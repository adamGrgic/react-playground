[new project]
Created a new project "configme" which is to help nail down some of the basic configurations for react . I wanted to start diving into an e-commerce project, but I want to make sure I have some of the specifics of react configuration nailed down .

todo:

(x) setup project with typescript
(x) setup eslint / prettier 
setup react routing 
create production build 
add yaml file


What I have in mind currently for a new ecommerce project is to create a main, storefront page that users access when they first access the website. Would also like to put together a 
product page, a contact page, a catalog page, and an about page. 

Some of this stuff I think will require some research on my end to see what is expected from an ecommerce website and hopefully apply it here. 

Will also need to figure out what I'm doing with typescript, prettier, and linter. Additionally, I think it would be cool to put together some sort of admin ui for managing different 
technical aspects of the database. 

sidenote: would maybe like to do the same thing but with yml files / eslint
